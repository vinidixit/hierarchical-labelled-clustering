 Research paper available here https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3493700.3493727
 
Clustering approach based on Itemset mining and embeddings.
- **feature_processing**: phrase extraction, selection, feature embedding clustering and reduction
- **clustering**: generalized closed frequent itemset mining on embed reduced/grouped features as items to get hierarchical clusters and topics, label name generation of topics
